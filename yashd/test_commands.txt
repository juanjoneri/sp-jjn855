-----------------Basic Commands-----------------:

ls

hello

echo fkdjsalf lfjdasl lfaj;dflkasdj;

-----------------File Redirection-----------------:

echo hello > tmp/1.txt
cat < tmp/1.txt

echo this is 2 > tmp/2.txt
cat < tmp/2.txt > tmp/1.txt

-----------------Pipe-----------------:

echo this is 1 | cat > tmp/1.txt

cat < tmp/2.txt > tmp/3.txt | cat < tmp/1.txt

-----------------Input within process/Signals-----------------:

cat -- Just make sure the following input are sent back to yash
    hello

    jdlksaf jfldks lkfjdsalfj;sda lkfjdsalfj

    ^c

sleep 5
    ^z

sleep 5
    ^c

-----------------Close Socket-----------------:

^d 
NOTES:
* Make sure yash exits fine
    * I have had problems sometimes where I lose control of terminal after ^d
* Make sure yashd closes the socket, but the program does not exit
    * We can just run 2 yash, put in a ^d for 1, and make sure the other still works as expected



TODO: -----------------jobs/fg/bg-----------------:
We need to reimplement the job_table for yashd and then we can test this as well
